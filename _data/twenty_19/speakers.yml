  topic: The Women Writers Project
  description: The <a href='https://wwp.northeastern.edu/'>Women Writers Project</a> is a long-term research project devoted to early modern women's writing and electronic text encoding. Our goal is to bring texts by pre-Victorian women writers out of the archive and make them accessible to a wide audience of teachers, students, scholars, and the general reader. We support research on women's writing, text encoding, and the role of electronic texts in teaching and scholarship.
  bio: Sarah Connell is the Assistant Director of the Women Writers Project and the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University. Her research focuses on text encoding and text analysis, medieval and early modern literature and historiography, and pedagogies of digital scholarship. Her current projects include Making Room in History, a text encoding and analysis project on early modern narratives of national identity; an analysis of the works of Margaret Cavendish through TEI encoding; and an NEH-funded seminar series on research and teaching with word embedding models.

  bio: "<p>Gregory Crane's interests are twofold. On the one hand, he has published on a wide range of ancient Greek authors (including articles on Greek drama and Hellenistic poetry and a book on the Odyssey). Much of his traditional scholarly work has been devoted to Thucydides; his book The Blinded Eye: Thucydides and the New Written Word appeared from Rowman and Littlefield in 1996; his second Thucydides book (The Ancient Simplicity: Thucydides and the Limits of Political Realism) was published by the University of California Press in 1998.</p>
  <p>At the same time, he has a long-standing interest in the relationship between the humanities and rapidly developing digital technology. He began this side of his work as a graduate student at Harvard when the Classics Department purchased its first TLG authors on magnetic tape in the summer of 1982. He developed a Unix-based full text retrieval system for the TLG that was widely used in North America and Europe in the middle 1980s. He also helped establish a typesetting consortium to facilitate scholarly publishing. Since 1985 he has been engaged in planning and development of the Perseus Project, which he directs as the Editor-in-Chief. Besides supervising the Perseus Project as a whole, he has been primarily responsible for the development of the morphological analysis system which provides many of the links within the Perseus database.</p>
  <p>From 1998 through 2006 he directed a grant from the Digital Library Initiative to study general problems of digital libraries in the humanities. Under the DLI-2 program, he worked on a range of topics, including such topics as London, the history of Mechanics, and the American Civil War. Each of these collections provided new insights into the implications of such new electronic tools on learning. In 2006, he produced a named entity identification system, published a 55 million word collection, and authored several publications describing the system.</p>
  <p>With the rise of the Google Books project in 2004, he began to focus upon the problems and opportunities that arise when whole libraries rather than curated collections become available on-line. The broad range of projects that he suppported with support from the DLI-2 program, the Institute for Museum and Library Services, and the Mellon Foundation provided a broad foundation within which to frame his current generation of research projects on Classical Studies at Perseus. Crane overees the overall research program at Perseus.</p>
  <p>Crane is especially interested in helping the emerging Cyberinfrastructure serve the needs of the humanities in general and classical studies in particular.</p>"

  topic: The Encoded 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner
  description: "<p>Among the rare musical treasures housed at Boston College’s John J. Burns Library, is an early 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner (<a href='http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu'>http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu</a>). Bound between leather-covered boards, the volume now comprises 119 parchment folios containing Gregorian chants for the entire annual calendar of saints’ days (the sanctorale). While the precise date and provenance of the manuscript remain a mystery, there is reason to believe that it was copied by a German scribe, probably for use in Germany. Rather than a luxury manuscript distinguished by superb calligraphy and expert illumination, this volume was copied for daily use by monks chanting the divine office. For its interest to both specialists and the wider public, it was chosen as one of the few BC library holdings to be represented in the 2016 exhibition Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections (<a href='http://beyondwords2016.org'>http://beyondwords2016.org</a>).</p><p>The Antiphoner contains 846 musical works and although the BC library had already made the entire volume available online as an open access digital object, none of those 846 musical works was indexed or searchable. Our project sought to provide deeper access and interactive functionality for both students and researchers accessing the object online, as well as for the public attending the 2016 Beyond Words exhibition. First, to maximize user experience and to make the content analyzable, the project incorporated encoded metadata providing a means of searching each of the melodic incipits. This means that the first melodically meaningful phrase of each chant, identifying it uniquely, was encoded so that the presence of any known chant in the manuscript could easily be established through searchable incipits. The digitized object and encoded content was thus made available via a responsive website. Second, the project sought to provide museum-goers with an opportunity to experience and interact with the Antiphoner digitally via a multi-touch table. In addition, we sought to enhance the images of the source with videos and audio clips of specially commissioned recordings of the music preserved in the Antiphoner. Through the addition of explanatory texts together with audio and video recordings of performances of some of the Antiphoner’s melodies, we sought to bring the audience into closer and richer contact with the artifact than would have been possible with the physical object alone.</p><p>Additionally, access to the raw data files of encoded content offers additional analytical tools for scholars and students. While the Beyond Words exhibition presented us with the opportunity to offer a rich multi-media experience to the museum-goer, we set our sights firmly on providing a long-term project of enduring benefit to both students and researchers. In particular, through close co-operation with the international CANTUS database (<a href='http://cantusdatabase.org'>http://cantusdatabase.org</a>), we contributed to the most important scholarly database of medieval music.</p>"
