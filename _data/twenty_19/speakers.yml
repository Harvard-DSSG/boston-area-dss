  topic: The Encoded 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner
  description: "<p>Among the rare musical treasures housed at Boston College’s John J. Burns Library, is an early 14th-century Franciscan Antiphoner (<a href='http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu'>http://burnsantiphoner.bc.edu</a>). Bound between leather-covered boards, the volume now comprises 119 parchment folios containing Gregorian chants for the entire annual calendar of saints’ days (the sanctorale). While the precise date and provenance of the manuscript remain a mystery, there is reason to believe that it was copied by a German scribe, probably for use in Germany. Rather than a luxury manuscript distinguished by superb calligraphy and expert illumination, this volume was copied for daily use by monks chanting the divine office. For its interest to both specialists and the wider public, it was chosen as one of the few BC library holdings to be represented in the 2016 exhibition Beyond Words: Illuminated Manuscripts in Boston Collections (<a href='http://beyondwords2016.org'>http://beyondwords2016.org</a>).</p><p>The Antiphoner contains 846 musical works and although the BC library had already made the entire volume available online as an open access digital object, none of those 846 musical works was indexed or searchable. Our project sought to provide deeper access and interactive functionality for both students and researchers accessing the object online, as well as for the public attending the 2016 Beyond Words exhibition. First, to maximize user experience and to make the content analyzable, the project incorporated encoded metadata providing a means of searching each of the melodic incipits. This means that the first melodically meaningful phrase of each chant, identifying it uniquely, was encoded so that the presence of any known chant in the manuscript could easily be established through searchable incipits. The digitized object and encoded content was thus made available via a responsive website. Second, the project sought to provide museum-goers with an opportunity to experience and interact with the Antiphoner digitally via a multi-touch table. In addition, we sought to enhance the images of the source with videos and audio clips of specially commissioned recordings of the music preserved in the Antiphoner. Through the addition of explanatory texts together with audio and video recordings of performances of some of the Antiphoner’s melodies, we sought to bring the audience into closer and richer contact with the artifact than would have been possible with the physical object alone.</p><p>Additionally, access to the raw data files of encoded content offers additional analytical tools for scholars and students. While the Beyond Words exhibition presented us with the opportunity to offer a rich multi-media experience to the museum-goer, we set our sights firmly on providing a long-term project of enduring benefit to both students and researchers. In particular, through close co-operation with the international CANTUS database (<a href='http://cantusdatabase.org'>http://cantusdatabase.org</a>), we contributed to the most important scholarly database of medieval music.</p>"

  topic: The Visualizing Maritime History Project
  description: The <a href="http://forbesandclark.archimedes.digital/">Visualizing Maritime History Project (VHMP)</a> offers users access to over 3800 objects in two collections of the MIT Museum. These two collections, the Captain Arthur H. Clark Collection and the Allan Forbes Whaling Collection, were donated to MIT in the first half of the twentieth century. A substantial grant from the Maritime Heritage Grant Program of the United States National Park Service, and additional support from the MIT Museum and the MIT School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences, has allowed us to catalogue and photograph these collections for the first time.

  topic: The Women Writers Project
  description: The <a href='https://wwp.northeastern.edu/'>Women Writers Project</a> is a long-term research project devoted to early modern women's writing and electronic text encoding. Our goal is to bring texts by pre-Victorian women writers out of the archive and make them accessible to a wide audience of teachers, students, scholars, and the general reader. We support research on women's writing, text encoding, and the role of electronic texts in teaching and scholarship.
  bio: Sarah Connell is the Assistant Director of the Women Writers Project and the NULab for Texts, Maps, and Networks at Northeastern University. Her research focuses on text encoding and text analysis, medieval and early modern literature and historiography, and pedagogies of digital scholarship. Her current projects include Making Room in History, a text encoding and analysis project on early modern narratives of national identity; an analysis of the works of Margaret Cavendish through TEI encoding; and an NEH-funded seminar series on research and teaching with word embedding models.

  description: Electronic Musical Instrument Design teaches students how to make electronic performance systems and gesture controllers for music. Students from a variety of disciplines including electrical and mechanical engineering, computer science, physics, human factors engineering, sculpture, and music work on projects in teams. From the instructor and each other they learn analog and digital sensor technology, computer-assisted design and fabrication, coding using Max/MSP, MIDI, synthesis, and digital signal processing and mixing. Examples of student work can be seen at <a href='http://tuftsemid.com'>http://tuftsemid.com</a>.
